# Lotus Orbs
Divided attention is a type of simultaneous attention that allows us to process different information sources and successfully carry out multiple tasks at a time.

**Lotus Orbs** is a game which tests your divided attention and reaction time. Use deflectors to guide colored orbs into the same colored collector. Every incorrect deflection will result in a loss of 1 health point, but every 3 correct deflections results in a restoration of 1 health point.

The concept is simple, but as the timer increases:

- The orbs will spawn at a faster rate
- The speed of the orbs will increase
- The color of the collectors will change at a faster rate

**Orbs-** Guide these circular shaped objects into their respective collectors of the same color by using deflectors.

**Deflectors-** Press near the deflector in the direction you want the orb to travel in order to change the path.

**Collectors-** These keep changing color and must only collect orbs of the same color.
